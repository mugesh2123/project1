# Pentesting - altoro mutual Web app using zap
tool used:
 1.zap
 2.burp suite
 3.Virtual box
 4.kali linux
 # zap
   I will scan the Altoro Mutual website using the ZAP tool for automation. The process will involve using ZAP’s fuzzing and spidering features to find subdomains. It will  input malicious code to test for vulnerabilities, analyze the results with ZAP, and generate a report highlighting the vulnerabilities found.
 # burp suite
  I will use Burp Suite to capture and intercept requests and responses, modify the website's content, and test for vulnerabilities like XSS and others in the Altoro Mutual web application
# exploit the medium level vulnerabilities
  After generating the report, I will identify medium-level risks such as CSRF and CSP-XSS vulnerabilities. I will exploit these vulnerabilities to understand the loopholes and then fix them — for example, by adding a CSRF token and adjusting the 'SameSite' attribute to 'Lax' or 'Strict' to address CSRF issues, and implementing proper Content Security Policy (CSP) settings to prevent script injections.
